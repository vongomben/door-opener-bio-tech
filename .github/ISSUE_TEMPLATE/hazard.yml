      description: If you are applying for the kit, you'll may have identified a common (or less common) recurring hazard or possible disaster in your region. How would you define your solution based on the [TRL chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level). (Note! We obviously expect your project to be in its primal states! Yet maybe you have had many experiments about it) The kit will try to bring your project to TRL >=5
